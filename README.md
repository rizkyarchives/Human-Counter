# M-Banking Simulator

A C Program that simulates an M-Banking application made for the final project of my Computer Fundamentals & Programming class. 
The features are:

- Login/Register system with each account having personal data, current balance, and account activity data (Deposit, withdraw, transfer, and payment history) using struct.
- Common m-banking features such as deposit, withdraw, transfer, and payment. There is also a confirmation feature for transfer that if the account number we input on the program does not match any account number that is stored, then the program would say that the account does not exists. All accounts' balance are also always updated whenever it received money by transfer from another account.
- Show account history feature which will show all logs of the account's activity. This utilizes struct as well.
- The ability to change password or edit account information.
- Security system. If a user incorrectly typed their password three times, the account would be temporarily deactivated.
